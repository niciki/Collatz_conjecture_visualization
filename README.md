The lower and upper limits of the required interval are fed to the input. The program will display the dependence of the i-th number on the number of steps required (<font color="blue">Blue</font> graph). <font color="orange">Orange</font> graph is the sorted number of attempts for all numbers from the given interval.
After executing the program, a graph is drawn, under which information is displayed about the number for which the minimum number of attempts must be made and about the number for which the maximum number of attempts must be made.
